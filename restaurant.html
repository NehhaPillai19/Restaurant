                This place is great! Atmosphere is chill and cool but the staff is also really friendly. They know what they’re doing and what they’re talking about, and you can tell making the customers happy is their main priority. Food is pretty good, some italian classics and some twists, and for their prices it’s 100% worth it.

                Excellent food. Menu is extensive and seasonal to a particularly high standard. Definitely fine dining. It can be expensive but worth it and they do different deals on different nights so it’s worth checking them out before you book. Highly recommended.

  <h2>Our story</h2>
<p id="para1">
    The flamingo-Restaurant is a small start-up  in Vellore. The love for food never ends.
    This plan was started on 19th of April 2015, which made us to the grand opening on 29th of December 2016 at Vellore, with an amazing name "The Flamingo-Restaurant".
    Our main idea is to invent as many dishes and serve you with good taste. We came with a few fusion dishes also.
